This game's main goal is to get the location's address, which is encrypted on a map. Pieces of the map are hidden in the map files across different floors. Once you find all the parts of the map you need to merge it to get a complete picture.
You can use only the commands below and their flags to move through floors/folders and look inside them:
->  The `cd` command changes the current working directory.
->  The `ls` command lists the contents of a directory.
->  The `cat` command outputs the contents of a file to the console. 
    Hint: you can use the output redirection symbol `>` to concatenate the content of few files to a new file or just to redirect the output to a new file.

On every floor, you might find the file named `README.md` with tips and questions. 
The answer to these questions will help you find the next folder you need for the next map's piece. 
If you pick the wrong folder with the answer you lose the game.

And the first tip is:
->  Find the 3-rd floor and run `cat README.md`
